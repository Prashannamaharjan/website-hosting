        My name is Prashanna Maharjan, and I am an enthusiastic Computer Science undergraduate at Taylorâ€™s University. I have a strong interest in frontend and backend development, with growing expertise in React and modern web technologies. Alongside programming, I have developed skills in UI/UX design, where I focus on creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.
        My creative side extends to graphic design, photography, and videography, allowing me to bring a unique perspective to digital projects. I have worked as a content creator and graphic designer, gaining hands-on experience in producing engaging visuals, videos, and promotional materials. These experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate with teams, adapt to new challenges, and deliver high-quality results under deadlines.
        I am also a React JS certified developer, which has enhanced my ability to design responsive and interactive web applications. My background in both technical and creative fields gives me a balanced skill set for solving problems with both logic and innovation.
        I am passionate about continuous learning and improving my skills to stay updated with the latest trends in technology. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects, grow as a developer, and create meaningful digital experiences that combine technology, design, and creativity.
